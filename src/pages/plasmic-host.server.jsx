/**
 * The Plasmic host page; this is the page that is used to render the artboards
 * inside the Plasmic studio; each artboard is an iframe pointing at this page.  
 * It needs to ultimately render the <PlasmicCanvasHost />, which is where Plasmic 
 * will inject the designs into the React tree.
 * 
 * This page also serves another important purpose -- it provides the Shopify
 * data needed to power some of the designs.  
 * 
 * For now, it just always supplies data for a hard-coded collection and a 
 * hard-coded product.  This is only for the purpose of the host page -- in
 * the "real" page, like /plasmic/product/[handle].server.jsx, the data is fetched
 * there according to the `handle` param.
 * 
 * We had tried to use setServerState() from the client to instruct this page
 * on what data exactly to fetch and provide. Unfortunately there may be some
 * bug (?) such that when simulatneous setServerState() requests are made to
 * the server, the response is missing the client components... ðŸ¤”
